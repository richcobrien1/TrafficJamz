# Mobile Apps Setup

The native iOS and Android apps have been successfully set up using Capacitor. The web client has been wrapped into native projects and placed in `mobile/Android` and `mobile/iOS`. These apps will function identically to the web client, including all features like audio sessions, location tracking, and UI styling.

## Next Steps:

### For Android:
1. Open the `mobile/Android` folder in Android Studio
2. Sync Gradle files
3. Run the app on a device or emulator

### For iOS:
1. On a macOS machine, open `mobile/iOS/App/App.xcworkspace` in Xcode
2. Select a development team
3. Run the app on a simulator or device

The apps are now ready for testing and deployment. If you need to update the apps with web client changes, rebuild the web app and run `npx cap sync` from the `jamz-client-vite` directory.

## TODO:
- [ ] Test Android app on device/emulator
- [ ] Test iOS app on simulator/device
- [ ] Deploy to app stores (Google Play, App Store)
- [ ] Set up CI/CD for automated builds</content>
