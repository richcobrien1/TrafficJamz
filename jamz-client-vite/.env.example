# Example environment file for jamz-client-vite
# Set VITE_API_BASE to the base URL the frontend should use for API requests.
# IMPORTANT: This project expects VITE_API_BASE to include the '/api' prefix when
# the backend routes are mounted under '/api'. For example:
#   - Development (backend running locally on port 5000):
#       VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:5000/api
#   - Production (served behind nginx which proxies /api -> backend):
#       VITE_API_BASE=/api
# If you prefer to set a base without '/api', set VITE_API_BASE accordingly and
# ensure your frontend request paths include the '/api' prefix.

# Example values:
VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:5000/api
#VITE_API_BASE=/api

# Optional: When running the frontend with Vite locally (Option A - recommended),
# set VITE_BACKEND_URL to the backend URL that Vite's dev server should proxy to.
# Example when backend is mapped to host port 5050 by docker-compose:
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5050

# WebSocket / Socket.IO URL for signaling. If left empty, the client will
# default to the page origin (window.location.origin), which is recommended
# for same-origin setups. Example:
# VITE_WS_URL=http://localhost:5000
# VITE_WS_URL=https://trafficjam.v2u.us
VITE_WS_URL=
