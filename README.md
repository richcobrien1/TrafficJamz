# TrafficJamz / Jamz

## Overview

TrafficJamz (Jamz) is a comprehensive real-time communication and location tracking platform designed for group activities. It provides secure, scalable audio communication and location services for subscribed users in active group settings.

## Core Features

### üéµ Real-Time Audio Communication
- **Group Voice Chat**: Full-duplex audio communication between group members
- **Music Streaming**: Shared music playback across the group
- **Audio Controls**: Independent mute controls for microphone and speakers
- **WebRTC Powered**: Low-latency peer-to-peer audio using MediaSoup

### üìç Real-Time Location Tracking
- **Live Location Sharing**: GPS tracking with real-time position updates
- **Proximity Alerts**: Audio notifications for group member distances
- **Location History**: Historical location data with InfluxDB time-series storage
- **Privacy Controls**: Granular location sharing permissions (precise, approximate, hidden)
- **Geographic Anchor Pins**: Map pins are anchored to geographic coordinates and move naturally with map panning and zooming. Pin positions update automatically as the map viewport changes, maintaining their real-world positions.

### üë• Group Management
